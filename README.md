About the project:
The goal of this project was to create a password generator. All the user has to do is click the generate button and then enter in their preferences. The password is then generated to their specifications, with as much randomness as possible. The randomness is done using a random number generator that is selecting from every available character based on what the user selected.

Built using:
HTML CSS and Javascript

Usage:
The user will need to click the generate button, at that point they will be prompted to answer a few question:
They first need to specify the length of their desired password. It needs to be more than 7 and less than 129. If the user enters a number that is outside of that range, or enters in a letter, they will be prompted to retry.
After that they will have four different confirm buttons to answer. They will offer the user different character types. Those being lower case letters, upper case letters, numeric values and special characters. If the user does not select any character types they will be prompted to start the process all over again. 
Once the user has selected their specifications a password will pop up in an alert and in the text area.

If the user does not select any character types an alert will pop up letting the user know that they have to try again

Once all of the specifications are set the password will pop up in an alert box

After the alert has been exited the password will also be in the text area
